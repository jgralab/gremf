# grEMF
grEMF provides an integration between the modeling framework EMF and the Java graph library JGraLab.

## Installation and building

### General information
The `gremf` project depends on the JGraLab project `jgralab` and the EMF subprojects `org.eclipse.emf.ecore` and `org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi`. Thus, there are indirect dependencies to the JGraLab project `common` and the EMF subproject `org.eclipse.emf.common`, but see the respective build instructions for a more detailed overview. The `gremf` project is based on specific versions of the mentioned dependencies:

* `jgralab` project: special branch, currently named `grEMF_test`
* EMF subprojects: build M6 of EMF 2.8, not yet available via the plugin's update site

Due to this dependencies it is assumed to checkout all relevant projects:

* [`jgralab`](https://github.com/jgralab/jgralab.git)
* [`commom`](https://github.com/jgralab/common.git)
* [`org.eclipse.emf.ecore`](git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/emf/org.eclipse.emf.git)
* [`org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi`](git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/emf/org.eclipse.emf.git)
* [`org.eclipse.emf.ecore.common`](git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/emf/org.eclipse.emf.git)

Start the building by checking out the `gremf` project:

		git clone https://github.com/jgralab/gremf.git

Generally, there a two different ways of using grEMF and therefore several build mechanisms.

#### Building as library using Ant
*Note:* [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) is needed

Copy the contained template file `template.user.properties` to `user.properties` and enter the required information. An example file is given below:

		eclipsehome.dir=/Applications/eclipse
		emfprojects.dir=/Users/demo/projects/emf/org.eclipse.emf/plugins
		istprojects.dir=/Users/demo/projects/jgralab

Use the included Ant script to build the `gremf` project:

		ant -f grEMF.xml build

#### Building as library using Eclipse

All projects are EMF projects as well allowing to use Eclipse for building. Note that in this case the JGraLab project `jgralab4eclipse` must be used instead of the plain `jgralab` project. Additionally, all projects must be present in the same Eclipse workspace.

#### Building as plugin
*Note:* The [Eclipse Plugin Environment](http://www.eclipse.org/pde/) is needed

It is necessary to carry out all steps of the previous section first. Afterwards, checkout the feature project `de.uni_koblenz.gremf`, which is contained in the `feature` folder within the `gremf` project, as a separate project into the same workspace. Use the included feature file `feature.xml` to deploy a working plugin containing all needed dependencies. The generated output have be added to the `dropins` folder in your eclipse home directory.

### API Documentation

You can generate a full API documentation using the Ant script:

		ant -f grEMF.xml document
